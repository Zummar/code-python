#Projects #Output I'm a developer and this repository I have created to share my task/projects with Codsoft. I used Pycharm for these projects.
(1)Calculator(PROJECT): Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.This project does not have any external dependencies, so you don't need to install additional libraries. 1:Running the Program: Save the code you provided into a Python file with a .py extension. For example, you can name it calculator.py. 2:Run the Program: To execute the program, simply type python calculator.py and press Enter. This will start the calculator. 3:Using the Calculator:Once the program is running, you'll see a menu with options for different arithmetic operations. Type the number corresponding to the operation you want to perform and press Enter. Depending on your choice, the program will prompt you to enter two numbers. Enter the numbers and press Enter. The program will display the result of the chosen operation. 4:Exiting the Calculator: To exit the calculator, type 0 and press Enter. The program will display a message indicating that it is closed, and then you can close the command prompt or terminal. 5:Invalid Input: If you enter an option other than the provided choices or if you attempt to divide by zero, the program will display an "Invalid input" message.

(2)TO-DO List(PROJECT): This is a simple To-Do List application created using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to add and remove tasks with optional due dates. 1:Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project utilizes the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly graphical interface for managing a to-do list. 2:Task Management: Users can add tasks to the list by entering task descriptions and optional due dates in the provided input fields. The "Add Task" button allows for task addition. 3:Displaying Tasks: Tasks are displayed in a scrollable text widget using the scrolledtext module. Each task is numbered and includes an empty checkbox, indicating an unfinished task. 4:Removing Tasks: Users can select a task by clicking on it, and then, using the "Remove Task" button, remove the selected task from the list. 5:Interactive User Experience: The application provides a responsive and interactive user experience, making it easy to add, view, and manage tasks. 6:Clearing Input Fields: After adding a task, the input fields for task description and due date are automatically cleared, allowing for quick task entry. 7:Error Handling: The code checks for empty task descriptions and gracefully handles optional due dates. It also allows for the removal of tasks by selecting them from the displayed list. 8:Main Window Geometry: The dimensions of the main GUI window are set to 700x600 pixels, providing a suitable display area for tasks. 9:Local Application: The project is intended to be run locally on a computer with Python installed. Users can interact with the GUI to manage their to-do list tasks. 10:Simplified Task Management: This To-Do List application offers a simplified way to organize and track tasks, making it ideal for personal use or as a starting point for more advanced task management applications.

(3)Rock Papar Scissor Game(PROJECT): This project showcases a simple, interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a user-friendly GUI. Users can play the game, track their scores, and reset the game as desired. It's a fun and visually appealing application that demonstrates the use of Tkinter for creating games and interactive interfaces. 1:Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project uses Tkinter to create a user-friendly graphical interface for a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 2:User vs. Computer: The game allows the user to play against the computer. The user and computer make choices, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game. 3:Scorekeeping: The game keeps track of the user's and computer's scores and displays them on the GUI. 4:Game Logic: The game logic determines the winner based on the choices of the user and the computer. It accounts for both user wins and computer wins. 5:Emoji Representations: Emojis are used to represent the choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors) made by the user and the computer, enhancing the visual appeal of the game. 6:Result Display: The game displays the result of each round, including whether it's a tie, a user win, or a computer win. The result is shown in a clear and user-friendly manner. 7:Reset Functionality: The "Play Again" button allows users to reset the game, clearing the scores and result, and starting a new game. 8:Responsive GUI: The graphical interface is responsive and well-designed, with clear labels and buttons. 9:Main Window Geometry: The dimensions of the main GUI window are set to 400x400 pixels, providing a suitable display area for the game. 10:User Interaction: Users can click on buttons to make their choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the game responds to their selections with the outcome. 11:Global Variables: Global variables are used to store and update user and computer scores, ensuring the scores persist between game rounds. 12:Lambda Functions: Lambda functions are used to associate the play_game function with each of the choice buttons, passing the user's choice as an argument.
